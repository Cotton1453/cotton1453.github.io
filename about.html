        <p>We are four girls who met through the Girls Who Code summer immersion program at Akamai. We were inspired to create a change for homeless women after watching various Youtube videos that documented their everyday struggle with feminine hygiene. </p>
        <p>Through a series of interactive menstruation-related games, Cotton raises awareness of how something so universal affects a group that is commonly ignored. Users themselves can make an impact in their community, while also educating themselves of the importance of feminine hygiene.</p>
